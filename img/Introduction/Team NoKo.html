                                DNA origami is known as an innovative technology that can build various 2D and 3D
                                nanostructures
                                using DNA strands. In conventional procedure, DNA origami is folded in bulk solution
                                such as
                                in
                                a test tube. Here, we present our project “SynthePHERE”, which aims at the folding of
                                DNA
                                origami nanostructures in a small compartment such as in a liposome.

                                As a first step, giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) containing scaffold and
                                staple　strands
                                are
                                prepared. The DNA origami nanostructures are folded in GUVs with the temperature control
                                of
                                the
                                solution. Since scaffold and staple strands are inside of a small reaction system of
                                GUVs,
                                faster and efficient DNA origami folding is expected.

                                <br>
                                Additionally, introduction of staple strands into GUVs through the pores on the membrane
                                surfaces is carried out. A membrane protein streptolysin O(SLO) is used to form pores
                                with ≈
                                27
                                nm diameter on GUV membrane surfaces. Also, SLO can get sealed when calcium ions are
                                added.
                                By
                                closing SLO pores, scaffold and staple strands are expected to be entrapped in GUVs,
                                allowing to
                                fold DNA origami nanostructures inside GUVs.

                                By introducing different staple strands into a small compartment, various DNA
                                nanostructures
                                can
                                be folded as a response. This input-output system would be applied to liposome-type

                                robots that can respond to outer environments, which could be used as drug delivery

                                Modern robots receive a large amount of information, data and stimuli from external
                                environments and operate their programmed actions based on received and processed
                                information. In order for robots to be multifunctional and high-performance, the ability
                                of mass data processing is essential. In recent years, biomolecules such as DNA, protein
                                and lipids are well studied and can even be artificially designed.
                                By combining the functions of various natural or designed biomolecules, construction of
                                various types of molecular robots and devices have been achieved. These
                                prototype molecular robots are designed for single or several inputs and corresponding
                                outputs. However, molecular robots reported until today have not been investigated
                                enough whether they can handle large amounts of inputs, nor do they have the capacity to
                                handle such amounts of inputs.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                In our first project, we investigated whether it is possible to introduce a large number
                                of inputs to molecular robots. Liposomes were adopted as the chassis model of molecular
                                robots and DNA strands were adopted as input signals which were transported through
                                liposomal membranes. DNA strands were introduced to liposomes through pore-forming
                                membrane protein, Streptolysin O(SLO)
                                By using the introduced DNA strands, assembly of DNA origami nanostructures are expected
                                to be attained as outputs. DNA origami is a nanoscale folding technology that enables
                                the construction of two- or three- dimensional nanostructures with arbitrary shapes by
                                using designed DNA strands.

                                Two types of DNA strands, scaffolds and staples are used for the construction of DNA
                                origami nanostructures. Scaffolds are long single stranded DNA with thousands of bases,
                                while staples are short (dozen bases) DNA strands that bind to corresponding areas of
                                scaffolds.
                                <figure>

                                As a second project, we examined whether DNA origami nanostructures can be formed inside
                                liposomes by introducing material DNA strands and annealing the DNA strands-including
                                liposomes. After the introduction of DNA strands through SLO pores, the pores were
                                closed by the addition of calcium ions, which makes the liposomes closed systems. DNA
                                origami nanostructures were assembled inside the liposomes by conventional annealing
                                process. The assembled DNA nanostructures were collected by destructing the liposomes
                                and evaluated by the comparison to the nanostructures assembled in the bulk solution.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Since liposomes provide smaller compartments compared to the bulk environment, folding
                                DNA nanostructures inside liposomes may provide more efficient assembly of DNA
                                nanostructures such as in faster time and lower staple concentrations.
                                Our ultimate goal is to establish a basic technology for the construction of
                                liposome-type molecular robots that receive a large amount of inputs and provide outputs
                                corresponding to the input. In our projects, we evaluated the assembly of DNA
                                nanostructures inside the liposomes with the introduction of material DNA strands. It is
                                the robust model for the molecular robots that receive a large amount of data and
                                stimulus. We believe that our project will serve as a milestone for the future
                                construction of liposomal molecular robots that can accept and process a large amount of
                                inputs.

                                Since DNA strands are hydrophilic molecules, they cannot be permeated
                                through the lipid membrane of the liposome. To overcome this, it is
                                necessary to form molecular transport pathways (pores) to the lipid
                                membrane surface. Previous researches succeeded in the transportation of
                                dye molecules, proteins and DNA strands from external environment to
                                inside environment through lipid membrane of the liposome by using
                                pore-forming membrane proteins [ref] and pore-shaped DNA nanostructures [ref],

                                Our project requires forming pores on the liposome membrane that can transport DNA
                                strands with a
                                diameter of &gt;2 nm, and then closing the pore. To achieve these, we selected streptolysin
                                O (SLO)
                                as a pore-forming material . SLO is a pore-forming membrane protein that can form pores
                                on lipid
                                membranes with approximately 27 nm diameter, which is considered large enough to
                                transport DNA
                                strands Moreover, SLO can close its pore by adding calcium ions [ref].
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                In the actual experimental system, the procedure is divided into three
                                steps; (i)SLO are added to the liposome solution, (ii) following the
                                addition of DNA strand mixture (iii) and then CaCl2 solution is added. By
                                addition of SLO to the liposomes in (i), the pore is formed on the liposomal
                                membrane and the liposome will be able to receive the DNA strands mixed in
                                procedure (ii). Finally, the SLO pore is closed by CaCl2 solution in (iii).
                                Through these series of operations, the DNA strand is transported to the
                                liposome by the SLO pore and a closed system will be formed. The
                                transportation of DNA strands can be evaluated by observing fluorescence
                                molecules attached to the DNA strands using a confocal microscope.

                                Several guidelines were set for designing the DNA origami nanostructures
                                assembled in our experimental system.
                                One is to design a three-dimensional DNA origami structure. Previous studies
                                have shown that DNA origami can be folded more efficiently (faster and with
                                fewer stapled strands) in micro-sized compartments (droplets) formed with s
                                urfactants. In this research, two-dimensional structures with triangular or
                                rectangular shapes were investigated. We expected this efficient folding
                                would be possible also within liposomes. Moreover, we were interested in
                                whether this efficient folding could be achieved with a 3D structure, thus
                                we adopted a three-dimensional shape.

                                The second point is to design the nanostructures larger than the SLO pore diameter. The
                                leakage of assembled DNA nanostructures must be avoided. To satisfy this point, the
                                vertical and horizontal lengths of the structures were designed to be
                                larger than the SLO pore diameter of 27 nm.

                                We designed the three-dimensional DNA origami nanostructure of a rectangular
                                shape shown in Fig.X using cadnano. The approximate size of the nanostructure is 29 x 39
                                x 10 nm, which was considered to be larger than the SLO pore. Thermodynamic simulations
                                by Cando suggested that the designed structure had
                                smaller thermal fluctuations and higher stability (Fig. Y). The cadnano map and sequence

                                As generally longer annealing time is required for 3D DNA origami nanostructures, it was
                                as we expected that the structural bands d

                                is required for proper assembly.

                                Since our project goal is to fold DNA origami nanostructures in liposomes, potential
                                damage to liposomes such as high temperature is better to be avoided. For this reason,
                                modified annealing conditions without a hot process of 85°C were investigated. The
                                modified annealing process is defined as protocol #2-2 and #3-2, respectively. Figure X
                                shows the electrophoresis result of the DNA origami assembled by #2-1, #2-2, #3-1, or
